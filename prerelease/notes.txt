line 616 - routine to get the token and return it to calling routines


A javasctipt routine to call icloud for verification.

Basically, I've added code at 238 to be called in the authenticate function to get the 2sv token in the same manner as the session token. It calls the idmsaApple.requestApple2SVToken to atually get it. At 274, the data statement will now contain the token that is posted with the other stuff back to Apple.

The problem I'm having is gettig idmsaApple.requestApple2SVToken to do the get without getting coding errors or 401 (authorization?) errors.
