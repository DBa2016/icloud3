### iCloud3 Change Log:



##### Version 0.86.1 - 1/25/2019

1. Fixed a problem where an error returning location data from the iCloud Find-my-Friends location request would crash iCloud3 and put it into an endless retry loop.
2. Changed the way log records (information, error, debug) are written to the HA log file. Also added a new *info logging* command that starts (and stops) writing debug records to the HA log file to make troubleshooting easier.
3. Changed the coordinates of the Dynamic Stationary Zone from 0째, 0째 (Papa New Guinea) to 0째,180째 (where the international date line crosses the equator).
4. Add Version information to the iCloud3.py file to support the Custom Control Updater program.
5. Added a Prerelease directory to the Github Repository for early versions of iCloud3.

##### Version 0.86 - 1/22/2019

1. Fixed a problem where devices were being excluded when they shouldn't have been. For example: if you had an *include_device: gary* and an *exclude_device: garyold* in the configuration file, gary was not being included in the devices being handled by iCloud3 when it should have been.
2. Added better support for more than one iCloud3 platform for different Apple iCloud accounts. The attributes now show the correct devices being tracked and the accounts they are associated with.
3. Updated the documentation to better explain naming devices on the device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) and in the HA IOS app. Also better explained what happens if you do not use the IOS app on the device.
